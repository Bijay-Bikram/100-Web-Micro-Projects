                <h2>The Problem</h2>
                <p>The successful 1953 summit of Mount Everest by Tenzing Norgay Sherpa and Sir Edmund Hillary pioneered
                    a booming industry
                    of climbing tourism in Nepal. The highest peak on the globe now serves as the ultimate challenge and
                    lifelong goal for
                    hundreds of expedition climbers each year</p>
            </div>
            <div class="article">
                <h2>Statistics</h2>
                <p>From 1953 to 2016, nearly 4,500 individuals from all over the world followed in the footsteps of
                    Hillary and Norgay,
                    summiting Mount Everest more than 7,600 times. 2017 was a record-breaking season; 375 climbers were
                    granted a permit to
                    attempt the summit, the most climbers in one year since 1953.

                    The launch point for climbing expeditions, Everest Base Camp (elevation 5,364m/17,598ft) sits on the
                    Khumbu Glacier. For
                    up to three months each year, this ‘tent city’ is a bustling temporary village, home to hundreds of
                    foreign climbers and
                    Sherpas seeking to summit. These months are spent acclimatizing as climbers prepare physically and
                    mentally for the
                    final 24-hour push to the tallest location on the globe, the Mount Everest summit (elevation
                    8,948m/29,029ft).</p>

                <h2>Impact</h2>
                <p>With decades of continued use and exploration, Everest Base Camp and the upper camps have become
                    scarred by
                    human
                    impact. Human waste dumped in Gorak Shep has ballooned to 26,000 pounds (12,000kg/12 tons) annually,
                    causing
                    environmental degradation and posing severe risks to clean water sources.</p>

            <div class="article">
                <h2>Clean-up Efforts</h2>
                <p>In an effort to clean up this renowned landmark, the Nepali government enacted regulations in 1991 to
                    mandate the
                    removal of waste generated at Everest Base Camp. The Sagarmāthā Pollution Control Committee was
                    created to
                    manage the
                    environmental protection of the Mount Everest National Park, which includes the oversight of waste
                    removal
                    and disposal.
                    However, due to the remote nature of the area, there has been no solution yet for the treatment or
                    safe
                    disposal of
                    human feces.</p>
