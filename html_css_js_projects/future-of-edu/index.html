            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is the transmission of knowledge, skills, and character
                traits. There are many types of education. Formal
                education happens in a complex institutional framework, like public schools. Non-formal education is
                also structured but
                takes place outside the formal schooling system. Informal education is unstructured learning through
                daily experiences.
                Formal and non-formal education are divided into levels. They include early childhood education, primary
                education,
                secondary education, and tertiary education. Other classifications focus on the teaching method, like
                teacher-centered
                and student-centered education.</p>

            <p class="sectionTag text-big">Let's Grow Together</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">A collaborative (or cooperative) learning approach
                involves pupils working together on activities or learning tasks in a
                group small enough to ensure that everyone participates. Pupils in the group may work on separate tasks
                contributing to
                a common overall outcome, or work together on a shared task.Collaborative learning groups work together
                to reach their goal, relying on each other for success. Thus, they need to
                learn to trust each other. Students who build trust in collaborative teams can form a more cohesive
                classroom bond
                knowing they support each other's learning</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Learn Anywhere is an innovative complete solution, allowing teachers to
                continue teaching in a traditional way and
                allowing students to attend classes anytime, anywhere.When students cannot be physically present in the
                classroom, digital
                collaboration is our best available option.
                Unfortunately, existing collaboration solutions have not been developed specifically with a classroom
                setting in mind.
